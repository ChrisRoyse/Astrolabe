# deploy-calyx-runner.sh (#1108): build the requested Calyx binaries from the
# repo checkout at origin/main and install them into the runner directory
# with a verified identity trail.
#
# Root cause this closes: /home/croyse/calyx/target/release/ is a hand-managed
# deploy directory, not a cargo target. Binaries were copied there ad hoc, so
# rebuilds in ~/calyx/repo never reached the runner path and probes silently
# ran weeks-old code. Every step here either verifies or fails loudly:
#
#   1. repo must be clean and exactly at origin/main (fetched fresh)
#   2. no live ingestion may be running
#   3. the built binary must self-report the expected git SHA (build-info)
#   4. install is a same-filesystem staged rename (atomic; a running process
#      keeps its old inode, so nothing observes a half-written binary)
#   5. the deployed binary is re-executed and must self-report the same SHA
#   6. a <binary>.deploy.json manifest records the deploy for later audit
#
# There are no fallback paths. Any gate failure exits non-zero with a
# CALYX_DEPLOY_* code naming exactly what failed and how to fix it.
#
# usage: deploy-calyx-runner.sh [--repo DIR] [--dest DIR] [--features LIST]
#                               [--binary calyx|calyxd|calyx-mcp]...
#                               [--allow-in-use]
#
#   --binary may repeat; default deploys only `calyx` (the runner CLI).
#   --allow-in-use permits deploying over a binary some process is currently
#     executing. This is rename-safe (the process keeps the old inode) but
#     the running process will NOT pick up the new code until restarted.
#
# Feature gate (#1116): the aiwonder runner is a CUDA host, so `calyx` and
# `calyxd` REQUIRE the `cuda` cargo feature. The 2026-07-02 outage happened
# because a featureless deploy shipped a CPU-only calyxd that passed every
# git-identity gate and only failed at service start. Two gates close that:
#   a. preflight: the requested --features must include each binary's
#      required features before anything is built
#   b. identity:  the built/staged/deployed binary must self-report its
#      embedded feature set (build-info `features`, #1116) and that set must
#      include the required features
# Both fail CALYX_DEPLOY_FEATURE_MISMATCH. A binary whose build-info lacks
# the `features` field predates #1116 and fails CALYX_DEPLOY_IDENTITY_UNREADABLE.
#
# Capability gate (#1130): feature names cannot prove what a DEPENDENCY crate
# compiled — a `cuda` calyx passed gate b while calyx-sextant's cuVS path was
# compiled out (the pre-#1130 cuda/cuda-sextant split) and failed at runtime.
# Gate c asserts the binary's self-reported resolved capability map
# (build-info `capabilities`, cfg!-derived consts from the owning crates):
# every capability in required_capabilities_for must be present and true.
# Failures: CALYX_DEPLOY_CAPABILITY_MISSING (compiled out),
# CALYX_DEPLOY_CAPABILITY_UNKNOWN (gate/binary schema drift), or
# CALYX_DEPLOY_IDENTITY_UNREADABLE (binary predates #1130).
